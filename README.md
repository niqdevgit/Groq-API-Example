# Groq-API-Example
Tuni course

Task: Groq API Integration 

Generate an API token. 
1. Use any Python API framework, such as Flask or FastAPI, to call this API. 
2. Use the API to perform tasks, such as translating English into your native 
language. 
3. Upload the implementation to GitHub and share the GitHub link in Google Colab. 


## Usage
- Clone the repo
- run the server: "uvicorn app:app --reload"
- have your API key on .env file
- send http request, via postman or VScode extension

## Note⚠️
The Groq API needed a credit card, so i was not able to fully test this code. It should work, if not make pull request :)
